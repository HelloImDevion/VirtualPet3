# VirtualPet3

I wanted to create a virtual Pet. I named it a pet Dragon with multiple features. The Dragon can Eat, Sleep, Play, Train, and Fly, depending on what you have enter thats in the list the pet should do one of those 5 things. The begin it will ask can you enter an action you would like the pet to do. The pet will do it, and you should see a side comment stating that the pet did the action you wanted it to do.
